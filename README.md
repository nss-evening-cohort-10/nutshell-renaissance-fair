# Description
Your task is to create a dashboard for the owners to keep track of the Food, Souvenirs, Shows, and Staff they have available across all locations. They should be able to perform full CRUD on each of those 4 topics. Additionally they should be able to authenticate into the application - if they are not authenticated the website should perform READ only operations.
